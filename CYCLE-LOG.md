## S1 — Monorepo scaffold, schemas, ADRs (2026-07-13)

**Shipped**
- Repo layout per DESIGN §3: `server/` (uv, Python 3.12, FastAPI), `reader/` and
  `admin-ui/` (Vite + React + TS scaffolds), `shared/` (schemas + generated
  types), `tools/`, `data/`.
- All eleven JSON Schemas in `shared/schemas/` (meta, structure, page, cast,
  selection, prompt, manifest, annotations, positions, users, styles) — draft
  2020-12, `additionalProperties: false` throughout (opaque TTS objects excepted,
  see inferences), `description` on every property.
- Deterministic TS type generation (`shared/gen-types.mjs`,
  `json-schema-to-typescript`) → committed `shared/types/*.d.ts`. Verified: two
  runs produce byte-identical output.
- `server/src/scriptorium/`: `config.py` (env contract), `schemas.py`
  (`validate(kind, obj)`), `app.py` (`GET /health`, degraded-not-500).
- `justfile` (`server-dev`, `reader-dev`, `admin-dev`, `server-test`, `test-all`,
  `lint-all`, `gen-types`).
- ADRs: `0000-template`, `0001`–`0010` transcribed from DESIGN §15; existing
  cycle-model ADR renumbered `0001` → `0012` (0011 reserved for imagegen at S10).
- Seeds: `data/styles.json` (four §9 styles), `CYCLE-LOG.md`,
  `NOTES-FOR-NEXT-CYCLES.md`.
- Tests: `test_schemas.py` (valid/invalid pair per kind, parametrized),
  `test_health.py` (ok / degraded-both-down / degraded-one-down / unconfigured).

**Decisions**
- ADR numbering: DESIGN §15 references ADR-0001…0010 by number throughout its
  prose, so that numbering is authoritative; the project-factory `0001-cycle-model`
  ADR was moved to `0012` to free the slot (confirmed with the human before build).

**Schema-detail inferences** (where DESIGN was abridged or silent, and the schema
had to decide):
- **Opaque verbatim objects vs `additionalProperties: false`.** `page.ledger`,
  `prompt.derived`, and `prompt.render.params_echo` are text-transform-service /
  imagegen output stored *verbatim*; their internal shape is owned by those
  services, not this repo. They are typed as generic `{"type": "object"}` (no
  inner `additionalProperties: false`); the strict `false` is enforced everywhere
  else. This is the one deviation from "additionalProperties:false throughout,"
  and it is deliberate — locking those shapes here would couple us to another
  repo's schema.
- **`meta.source.kind`** enum is `["gutenberg", "user"]` (the bundle-level origin
  class per §5.3), distinct from the admin API request `kind`
  (`gutenberg|text|markdown`), which is not stored in the bundle. `gutenberg_id`
  is optional (present only for gutenberg sources).
- **`bundle_version`** is modeled as `const 1` (v1 schemas validate v1 bundles);
  the field exists to distinguish future formats.
- **`page.ledger` is optional**, not required: published pages carry it, but early
  (P0) work-phase pages are "text only" (DESIGN §7.1), and the same schema
  validates both. Likewise `prompt.wrapped_prompt`/`negative_prompt`/`render` are
  optional (present after render; absent for draft prompts).
- **`cast`** encodes the §4.3 published-contract fields only; reducer intermediates
  (`is_person`, `descriptors` from §7.2) are work-phase and not in `cast.json`.
- **`positions`** has no top-level `book_id`/`user_id` — identity lives in the file
  path (`sync/positions/{user}/{book}.json`).
- **`prompt.page_id`** is a constrained string allowing `NNNN`, `cover`, or
  `portrait-{slug}` (pseudo-plates, DESIGN §10). `selection.plates[].page_id` is
  restricted to `NNNN` (cover/portraits live in `prompts/`, not `selection.json`).
- **`users[].color`** modeled as a CSS hex string (`#rrggbb`); DESIGN §14 says
  only "color". **`styles[].params.steps/cfg`** are nullable (int/number or null),
  null meaning "use imagegen default" (§9).
- **styles.json seed:** the `engraving` strings are verbatim from DESIGN §9; the
  `woodcut`/`watercolor`/`gouache-storybook` prefix/suffix/negative/portrait_prefix
  strings were composed to match §9's one-line descriptions (DESIGN gives full
  strings only for engraving). Tune later if renders warrant.
- **styles.json location:** placed at repo root `data/styles.json` as the committed
  seed (S1 scope wording); at runtime it is copied/loaded into `SCRIPTORIUM_DATA`
  (the repo cannot write `/var/lib`).

**Verification**
- `uv run pytest` → 29 passed. `uv run ruff check .` → clean.
- reader & admin-ui: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build` all green.
- TS gen determinism: two runs byte-identical (sha256 match).
